<p>If it is the case that you have for example Nessus or some other tool on an external machine, but you do not want to connect it straight into your network, you can route the nessus machine through your pentest machine that is connected to the network.</p>
<p>What you will basically do here is make your pentest machine into a router. And then connect your external machine to it, and route the traffic through through your router.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Connect external machine via ethernet to your pentest machine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Give external machine ip.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>ip a add 192.168.150.2/24 dev eth0
</code></pre>

<p>Bring the interface up again</p>
<pre><code>ip link set eth0 up
</code></pre>

<ol>
<li>Add routing rules</li>

<p>One good idea is to scan the network in metasploit. This will allow you to search its database. This will be necessary if the network is big. </p>
<p>https://www.offensive-security.com/metasploit-unleashed/using-databases/</p>
<pre><code>msfconsole
db_nmap



## List hosts and ports
services


## List hosts
hosts


## Import nmap file
db_import /path/to/file


## Export to CSV file
services -o file.csv

<h3 id="scan-safely">Scan safely<a class="headerlink" href="#scan-safely" title="Permanent link">#</a></h3>
<p>Nmap should not crash applications. It does not send malformed packets. If an application crashes it is because it is badly written. If they do crash the vendor should be alerted and the problem fixed.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Use SYN scan (-sS) instead of connect scan (-sT). User-mode applications such as web servers can rarely even detect the former because it is all handled in kernel space and thus the services have no excuse to crash.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Version scanning (-sV) and some of our NSE scripts (-sC or --script) risk crashing poorly written applications. Similarly, some buggy operating systems have been reported to crash when OS fingerprinted (-O). Omit these options for particularly sensitive environments or where you do not need the results.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using -T2 or slower (-T1, -T0) timing modes can reduce the chances that a port scan will harm a system, though they slow your scan dramatically. Older Linux boxes had an identd daemon that would block services temporarily if they were accessed too frequently. This could happen in a port scan, as well as during legitimate high-load situations. Slower timing might help here. These slow timing modes should only be used as a last resort because they can slow scans by an order of magnitude or more.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Limit the number of ports and machines scanned to the fewest that are required. Every machine scanned has a minuscule chance of crashing, and so cutting the number of machines down improves your odds. Reducing the number of ports scanned reduces the risks to end hosts as well as network devices. Many NAT/firewall devices keep a state entry for every port probe. Most of them expire old entries when the table fills up, but occasional (pathetic) implementations crash instead. Reducing the ports and hosts scanned reduces the number of state entries and thus might help those fragile and defective devices stay up.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="discover-network">Discover network<a class="headerlink" href="#discover-network" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>The first thing you need to do is to get to know the network a bit. </p>
<p>I usually try to inspect the network traffic a little bit before doing anything. 
NOTICE, that you will perform a DORA (dicovery, offer, request, ack) over DHCP. Iptables will thus NOT block dhcp-requests.
I configure iptables to drop all traffic, to make sure I don't interact with it in any way.</p>
<pre><code>iptables -P INPUT DROP
iptables -P OUTPUT DROP
iptables -P FORWARD DROP

ip6tables -P INPUT DROP
ip6tables -P OUTPUT DROP
ip6tables -P FORWARD DROP
</code></pre>

<p>NOTICE that when you run wireshark you will see your outgoing traffic even through iptables is droppping it. That is because wireshark is hooked up to the interface before iptables. So you will also see incoming traffic even though iptables drops it.</p>
<p>Just connect your machine to the ethernet or wifi, then check what ip-address and netmask you get.</p>
<pre><code>ip a
wlan0: &lt;BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP&gt; mtu 1500 qdisc mq state UP group default qlen 1000
    inet 10.10.1.10/24 brd 10.10.1.255 scope global dynamic wlan0
</code></pre>

<p>In this example you get a netmask of /24 (255.255.255.0).</p>
<p>You can easily see the network range, broadcast address and how many hosts by using <code>sipcalc</code></p>
<pre><code>sipcalc eth0
</code></pre>

<h2 id="discover-hosts">Discover hosts<a class="headerlink" href="#discover-hosts" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>Discovering hosts is fundamental. It is not impossible that the network you are on is a /8. That would be 16 million addresses. So we can't send a SYN packet to each port on all those 16 million hosts. That would take forever. In NMAP host discovery actions are called PING SCANS, although they are much more than simple ICMP Pings.</p>
<p>The challenge in discovering hosts is that you don't have all the time in the world. So you need to balance between time and result. More time gives you better result (if you port scan each port on all machines for example). You might not have the possibility to scan everything, because the network might be too big. Then you need to first identify all hosts, and then scan those.</p>
<h3 id="disable-jost-discovery">Disable jost discovery<a class="headerlink" href="#disable-jost-discovery" title="Permanent link">#</a></h3>
<p>You can disable host discovery, or ping scans with this flag</p>
<pre><code>-Pn
</code></pre>

<p>If the flag is included nmap will send packets to each host and port no matter what. Independet of if it doesn't exist. This might sometimes be useful if the host is not responding to any of the ping scan techniques, but is in fact open and exposes a port.</p>
<p>If you want to be 100% sure that you are not missing any hosts this option might be useful.</p>
<h3 id="exclude-hosts">Exclude hosts<a class="headerlink" href="#exclude-hosts" title="Permanent link">#</a></h3>
<p>If you have some really critical systems that you don't want to scan. ANd you don't want to get blamed if they go down, you can add an exclude-list</p>
<pre><code>--exclude, --excludefile &lt;filename&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Another good idea is simply to drop all packets to  those IP:s from your iptables rules.</p>
<p>Remember to take a tcpdump of all the traffic, this way you can prove that it wasn't you.</p>
<h3 id="perform-a-dry-run">Perform a dry run<a class="headerlink" href="#perform-a-dry-run" title="Permanent link">#</a></h3>
<p>To make sure that you haev added all the target flags correctly, you can always perform a dry run. Nmap will only make reverse DNS resolutions, but not packets are sent to the hosts. For example:</p>
<pre><code>nmap -sL 10.0.0.1/25
</code></pre>

<h3 id="discover-hosts_1">Discover hosts<a class="headerlink" href="#discover-hosts_1" title="Permanent link">#</a></h3>
<p>Okay, not lets get down to it.</p>
<ol>
<li>Very stealthy - Perform a simple reverse DNS resolution</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>nmap -sL 10.0.0.1/24 
</code></pre>

<p>This will make a DNS reverse resolution. This is an easy way to discover some hosts through the DNS.</p>
<ol>
<li>Less stealthy - Ping sweep
The <code>-sn</code> flag will disable the port scan. 
It perform a icmp ping, TCP SYN to 443 and TCP ACK to 80, and an ARP scan.</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>nmap -sn 10.0.0.1/24
</code></pre>

<p>This is actually a relly good, kind of stealthy command, but still useful.</p>
<p>It is equivalent to doing this:</p>
<pre><code>nmap -PE -PS443 -PA80 -PP -PE 10.0.0.1/24
</code></pre>

<p>Basically, the possibilities you haev to discover a host are the following:
- ARP broadcast
- ICMP PING
- TCP SYN to specified port (80/443)
- TCP ACK to specified port (80/443)
- UDP PING </p>
<p>THe difference an attacker can make i to change the TCP and UDP ports.</p>
<ul>
<li>IP Protocol PING</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="discover-services-ports">Discover services (ports)<a class="headerlink" href="#discover-services-ports" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<h3 id="terminology">Terminology<a class="headerlink" href="#terminology" title="Permanent link">#</a></h3>
<p>Nmap defines the state of a port according to the following:</p>
<p><strong>open</strong></p>
<pre><code>An application is actively accepting TCP connections or UDP packets on this port. Finding these is often the primary goal of port scanning. Security-minded people know that each open port is an avenue for attack. Attackers and pen-testers want to exploit the open ports, while administrators try to close or protect them with firewalls without thwarting legitimate users. Open ports are also interesting for non-security scans because they show services available for use on the network. Before you get too excited about an open port, note that it is possible that the application is protected with a TCP wrapper (tcpd) or that the application itself is configured to only service approved client IP addresses. Such cases still leave more attack surface than a closed port.
</code></pre>
<p><strong>closed</strong></p>
<pre><code>A closed port is accessible (it receives and responds to Nmap probe packets), but there is no application listening on it. They can be helpful in showing that a host is online and using an IP address (host discovery, or ping scanning), and as part of OS detection. Because closed ports are reachable, they may be worth scanning later in case some open up. Administrators may want to consider blocking such ports with a firewall so they appear in the filtered state, discussed next.
</code></pre>
<p><strong>filtered</strong></p>
<pre><code>Nmap cannot determine whether the port is open because packet filtering prevents its probes from reaching the port. The filtering could be from a dedicated firewall device, router rules, or host-based firewall software. These ports frustrate attackers because they provide so little information. Sometimes they respond with ICMP error messages such as type 3 code 13 (destination unreachable: communication administratively prohibited), but filters that simply drop probes without responding are far more common. This forces Nmap to retry several times just in case the probe was dropped due to network congestion rather than filtering. This sort of filtering slows scans down dramatically.
</code></pre>
<p><strong>unfiltered</strong></p>
<pre><code>The unfiltered state means that a port is accessible, but Nmap is unable to determine whether it is open or closed. Only the ACK scan, which is used to map firewall rulesets, classifies ports into this state. Scanning unfiltered ports with other scan types such as Window scan, SYN scan, or FIN scan, may help resolve whether the port is open.
</code></pre>
<p><strong>open|filtered</strong></p>
<pre><code>Nmap places ports in this state when it is unable to determine whether a port is open or filtered. This occurs for scan types in which open ports give no response. The lack of response could also mean that a packet filter dropped the probe or any response it elicited. So Nmap does not know for sure whether the port is open or being filtered. The UDP, IP protocol, FIN, NULL, and Xmas scans classify ports this way.

<h2 id="test-network-segmentation">Test network segmentation<a class="headerlink" href="#test-network-segmentation" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>Network segmentation is the act of splitting networks into different segmentation.</p>
<p>Segmenting the network can server different purposes, for example as a security measure to create strict walls between groups of servers/computers. Segmenting the network can limit the damage from an attack. If the attacker only access for example the client network, and not the servers. It will be more difficult for the attacker to reach critical data.</p>
<p>Reasons why network segmentation is a good idea.</p>
<ul>
<li>Improved Security. Network traffic can be isolated and / or filtered to limit and / or prevent access between network segments.</li>
<li>Better Access Control. Allow users to only access specific network resources.</li>
<li>Improved Monitoring. Provides an opportunity to log events, monitor allowed and denied internal connections, and detect suspicious behavior.</li>
<li>Improved Performance. With fewer hosts per subnet, local traffic is minimized. Broadcast traffic can be isolated to the local subnet.</li>
<li>Better Containment. When a network issue occurs, its effect is limited to the local subnet.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="test">Test<a class="headerlink" href="#test" title="Permanent link">#</a></h3>
<p>The easy way to test network segmentation is simply to access one segment. Ask someone with knowledge of the network for a host and port on another network segment, and the simply try to connect to that host.</p>
<p>Try an ICMP connect
SYN </p>
<p>Test for VLAN-hopping.</p>
<h2 id="vulnerability-scanning">Vulnerability scanning<a class="headerlink" href="#vulnerability-scanning" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p>Most of the time you will want to do a vulnerability scan of the network. A vulnerability scan will be more intrusive and send more aggressive payloads, than a simple nmap scan.
